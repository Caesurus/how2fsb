# how2fsb
Examples of FSB exploitable binaries that can be used to practice FSB. All these binaries are 32bit. Compiled on Ubuntu 16.04

### [Level 1](./level1)
This level was taken directly from the PicoCTF2017 challenge "Ive Got A Secret". It's a great intro into FSB. I downloaded the source and recompiled it.

### [Level 2](./level2)
First write!!! Introduction into using %n or %hn.

### [Level 3](./level3)
Second write. Introduction into actually writing the value you want in a specific location.

### [Level 4](./level4)
This one introduces the concept of updating the GOT to redirect execution to do what we want.

### [Level 5](./level5)
This requires multiple writes to achive the desired result. You need to utilize all the knowledge gained on levels 1-4 to get the flag.
